        <h1>Save your tears</h1>
    
        <p>
            Ooh<br>
            Na-na, yeah<br>
            I saw you dancing in a crowded room<br>
            You look so happy when I'm not with you<br>
            But then you saw me, caught you by surprise<br>
            A single teardrop falling from your eye<br>
            I don't know why I run away<br>
            I'll make you cry when I run away<br>
            You could've asked me why I broke your heart<br>
            You could've told me that you fell apart<br>
            But you walked past me like I wasn't there<br>
            And just pretended like you didn't care<br>
            I don't know why I run away<br>
            I'll make you cry when I run away<br>
            Take me back 'cause I wanna stay<br>
            Save your tears for another<br>
            Save your tears for another day<br>
            Save your tears for another day<br>
            So, I made you think that I would always stay<br>
            I said some things that I should never say<br>
            Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine<br>
            And now you won't love me for a second time<br>
            I don't know why I run away, oh, girl<br>
            Said I'll make you cry when I run away<br>
            Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay<br>
            Save your tears for another<br>
            I realize that I'm much too late<br>
            And you deserve someone better<br>
            Save your tears for another day<br>
            Save your tears for another day<br>
            I don't know why I run away<br>
            I'll make you cry when I run away<br>
            Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl<br>
            I said save your tears for another day<br>
            Save your tears for another day<br>
            Save your tears for another day<br>
        </p>
